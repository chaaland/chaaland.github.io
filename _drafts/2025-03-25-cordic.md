## Motivation

## Circular CORDIC

Suppose we want to compute the sine and cosine of $$\pi/5$$.
With CORDIC, we start with a unit vector lying on the positive $$x$$-axis which has an angle of 0.

    <figcaption>Figure 1: Initialisation of the CORDIC algorithm.</figcaption>
</figure>

We then rotate the vector counter-clockwise by $$\arctan(1) = \pi / 4$$ as shown in Figure 2.

    <figcaption>Figure 2: First iteration of CORDIC.</figcaption>
</figure>

We see that this overshoots our target angle of $$\pi /5$$ so we rotate the vector clockwise by $$\arctan(1/2)$$ as shown in Figure 3.

</figure>

This new vector still underestimates the target angle so we rotate clockwise again, but this time by $$\arctan(1/4)$$.

    <figcaption>Figure 4: Third iteration of CORDIC.</figcaption>
</figure>

We repeat this process of rotating clockwise or counterclockwise depending on whether our vector is currently over or under the desired angle.
Each iteration, the angle we rotate by gets progressively smaller.
Specifically, the angle at iteration $$k$$ is given by

$$\theta_k = \arctan(2^{-k})$$.

This is repeated either for a finite number of iterations or until some tolerance is reached.

    <figcaption>Figure 5: 11 iterations of CORDIC.</figcaption>
</figure>

The sine and cosine of $$\pi / 5$$ are then given by the $$y$$ and $$x$$ components of the final vector.

But how is the rotation of the vector computed?
Why are we rotating by this particular angle sequence?
Wouldn't it be simpler to use a sequence like $${\pi \over 4 \cdot 2^{k}}$$, decreasing the angle by half each time?

Starting with the first of these questions, the rotation matrix for an angle $$\theta$$ measured counter clockwise from the positive $$x$$-axis is given by

$$
U_\theta =
\begin{bmatrix}
\cos \theta & -\sin \theta \\
\sin \theta & \cos \theta \\
\end{bmatrix} =
\cos \theta
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & -\tan \theta \\
\tan \theta & 1 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Using our angle schedule of $$\theta_k = \arctan (2^{-k})$$, we see that each iteration of the CORDIC algorithm is performing the rotation

$$U_{\theta_k} =
\cos(\tan^{-1}(2^{-k}))
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & -\sigma_k\cdot \tan(\tan^{-1}(2^{-k})) \\
\sigma_k \cdot \tan(\tan^{-1}(2^{-k})) & 1 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

where $$\sigma_k$$ is 1 if the rotation is clockwise and -1 if counter-clockwise.
The cosine term essentially asks "what is the cosine of the angle whose tangent is $$2^{-k}$$?".
If the tangent is $$2^{-k}$$, then the opposite leg of the right triangle can be treated as $$2^{-k}$$ while the adjacent leg as 1.
This makes the hypotenuse $$\sqrt{1+2^{-2k}}$$, making  $$\cos \theta_k = (1+2^{-2k})^{-1/2}$$.

Our CORDIC rotation then simplifies to

$$U_{\theta_k} =
{1 \over \sqrt{1+2^{-2k}}}
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & -\sigma_k\cdot 2^{-k} \\
\sigma_k\cdot 2^{-k} & 1 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

It now becomes clear why we chose the angle schedule of $$\theta_k = \arctan(2^{-k})$$ rather than simply halving the angle at each iteration.

The rotation matrix requires computing the tangent.
Defining the angle based on the arctangent makes the computation trivial.
In applications using fixed point arithmetic (rather than floating point), this is as simple as a k-bit left shift.

In fact, plotting the two angle sequences, we see that the schedules are actually quite similar.

    <figcaption>Figure 6: arctangent angle schedule vs halving angle schedule.</figcaption>
</figure>

The full CORDIC computation is just a cascade of matrix multiplications against the unit vector on the $$x$$-axis

$$v =
\left(\prod_{k=0}^{N-1} {1 \over \sqrt{1+2^{-2k}}}\right)
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & -\sigma_{N-1}\cdot 2^{-{N-1}} \\
\sigma_{N-1}\cdot 2^{-{N-1}} & 1 \\
\end{bmatrix}
\cdots
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & -\sigma_0\cdot 1 \\
\sigma_0\cdot 1 & 1 \\
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
1 \\
0 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

The product in front is called the _gain_.
It depends only on the number of iterations, but not the direction of each individual rotation.
This means it can be computed offline and retrieved from a small lookup table.
Denoting the gain as $$K_N$$ and taking the logarithm, we have

$$\log K_N = -0.5 \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} \log \left({1 + 2^{-2k}}\right)$$

One natural question to ask is whether this series converges as $$N$$ goes to infinity.
Since $$\log(1+x) \approx x$$ for small $$x$$, we can see the series behaves similar to $$\sum_{k=0}^N 2^{-2k}$$ which is a convergent geometric series.
As shown in Figure 7, the product does indeed converge and rather rapidly to approximately $$0.607$$.

## Hyperbolic Functions

quick aside on hyperbolic functions

## Hyperbolic Rotations

A circular rotation $$\theta$$ is typically defined in terms of the arc length swept out on the unit circle.
Another way to view a rotation is by the _area_ of the sector it sweeps out.
For a circle of radius $$r$$ and an angle $$\theta$$, the ratio of the area of the sector to the full circle is the same as the ratio of the angle to that of the full circle.

$$
{A \over \pi r^2} = {\theta \over 2\pi}\\
$$

Rearranging terms, the area of the sector is $$A = {1 \over 2}r^2\theta$$.
For the unit circle, this simplifies to $$A= {\theta \over 2}$$.
So we can define an angle as twice the area of the sector it sweeps out (as shown in Figure 8).

<figure class="half">
    <a href="/assets/cordic/images/circular_angle_01.png"><img src="/assets/cordic/images/circular_angle_01.png"></a>
    <a href="/assets/cordic/images/circular_angle_02.png"><img src="/assets/cordic/images/circular_angle_02.png"></a>
    <figcaption>Figure 8: Area of sectors for different theta.</figcaption>
</figure>

Whereas the unit circle is defined as the points lying on the curve $$x^2 + y^2 = 1$$, the unit hyperbola is defined as the points lying on the curve $$x^2 - y^2 = 1$$.
Just as a circular angle can be defined as the area swept out by a vector on the unit circle, we can define a _hyperbolic angle_ as the area swept out by a vector lying on the right branch of the unit hyperbola.
Figure 9 shows two hyperbolic angles and their areas.

<figure class="half">
    <a href="/assets/cordic/images/hyperbolic_angle_01.png"><img src="/assets/cordic/images/hyperbolic_angle_01.png"></a>
    <a href="/assets/cordic/images/hyperbolic_angle_03.png"><img src="/assets/cordic/images/hyperbolic_angle_03.png"></a>
    <figcaption>Figure 9: Hyperbolic angles are defined as the area shown.</figcaption>
</figure>

We saw that for a circle, the area of the sector was related to the angle by a factor of one half, but what is the relationship between the area swept out and the hyperbolic angle?
From Figure 10 we see that the area can be computed by taking the area of the triangle and subtracting out the red portion.

While the unit circle can be parametrised by

$$
x(\theta) = \cos \theta\\
y(\theta) = \sin \theta
$$

, the right branch of the hyberbola is parametrised by

$$
x(\theta) = \cosh \theta\\
y(\theta) =  \sinh \theta
$$

where

$$
\begin{align*}
\cosh \theta &= {e^\theta + e^{-\theta} \over 2}\\
\sinh \theta &= {e^\theta - e^{-\theta} \over 2}\\
\end{align*}
$$

The blue area in Figure 10 is then given by

$$
A = {1 \over 2} \cosh \theta \sinh \theta - \int_1^{\cosh \theta} \sqrt{x^2-1}\, dx
$$

Making the substitution $$x = \cosh t$$ and $$dx = \sinh t\, dt$$

$$
\begin{align*}
A &= {1 \over 2} \cosh \theta \sinh \theta - \int_0^\theta \sinh^2 t\, dt\\
&= {1 \over 4} \sinh 2\theta - \int_0^\theta {1 \over 2} (\cosh 2t - 1)\, dt\\
&= {1 \over 4} \sinh 2\theta - {1 \over 2} \left({1 \over 2} \sinh 2t - t\right)_0^\theta\\
&= {1 \over 4} \sinh 2\theta - {1 \over 4}\sinh 2\theta +{\theta \over 2}\\
&= {\theta \over 2}
\end{align*}
$$

## Hyperbolic CORDIC

To compute sine and cosine, we used a circular rotation matrix

$$
U_\theta =
\begin{bmatrix}
\cos \theta & -\sin \theta\\
\sin \theta & \cos \theta\\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

to repeatedly rotate the vector by particular amounts depending on whether it was over or under the desired angle.
We can perform nearly the same procedure to compute the hyperbolic sine and cosine.
In particular, we define the hyperbolic rotation matrix

$$
H_\theta =
\begin{bmatrix}
\cosh \theta & \sinh \theta\\
\sinh \theta & \cosh \theta\\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

to rotate a vector.
Crucially, the vector is no longer rotated on the unit circle but on the right branch of the unit hyperbola.
Proceeding in the same way as circular CORDIC we use the angle schedule based on the inverse hyperbolic tangent rather than the inverse tangent

$$\theta_k = \tanh^{-1}(2^{-k})$$

Because $$\lim_{x\rightarrow \infty} \tanh^{-1} x = \infty$$, we start our index $$k$$ at 1 rather than 0.
Our hyperbolic rotation matrix can be written as

$$H_{\theta_k} =
\cosh(\tanh^{-1}(2^{-k}))
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & \sigma_k\cdot 2^{-k} \\
\sigma_k \cdot 2^{-k} & 1 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Using the identity $$\cosh^2 \theta - \sinh^2 \theta = 1$$ and dividing through by $$\cosh^2 \theta$$, we have

$$\cosh(\theta) = {1 \over \sqrt{1-\tanh^2 \theta}}$$

which leads to the simplified form of the hyperbolic rotation matrix

$$
H_{\theta_k} =
{1 \over \sqrt{1-2^{-2k} \theta}}
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & \sigma_k\cdot 2^{-k} \\
\sigma_k \cdot 2^{-k} & 1 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

$$v =
\left(\prod_{k=1}^{N} {1 \over \sqrt{1-2^{-2k}}}\right)
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & \sigma_{N}\cdot 2^{-N} \\
\sigma_{N}\cdot 2^{-N} & 1 \\
\end{bmatrix}
\cdots
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & \sigma_1\cdot 2^{-1} \\
\sigma_1\cdot 2^{-1} & 1 \\
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
1 \\
0 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$
