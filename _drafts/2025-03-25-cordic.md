## Motivation

Before the IEEE Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic was introduced in 1985, numerous methods existed representing and computing with decimal numbers.
Though modern CPUs and GPUs are equipped with dedicated circuitry for processing floating point numbers, this wasn't always the case.
In fact, even today most basic pocket calculators aren't equipped with the more complex circuitry for working with floating point numbers.
One common way to handle decimal numbers is with a fixed point format.

TODO caseyh: tie this into CORDIC and explain how sine and cosine an be done with just multiplies, adds and bit shifts.

## Circular CORDIC

Suppose we want to compute the sine and cosine of $$\pi/5$$.
With CORDIC, we start with a unit vector lying on the positive $$x$$-axis which has an angle of 0.

    <figcaption>Figure 1: Initialisation of the CORDIC algorithm.</figcaption>
</figure>

We then rotate the vector counter-clockwise by $$\arctan(1) = \pi / 4$$ as shown in Figure 2.

    <figcaption>Figure 2: First iteration of CORDIC.</figcaption>
</figure>

We see that this overshoots our target angle of $$\pi /5$$ so we rotate the vector clockwise by $$\arctan(1/2)$$ as shown in Figure 3.

    <figcaption>Figure 3: Second iteration of CORDIC.</figcaption>
</figure>

This new vector still underestimates the target angle so we rotate clockwise again, but this time by $$\arctan(1/4)$$.

<figure class>
    <a href="/assets/cordic/images/cordic_03.png"><img src="/assets/cordic/images/cordic_03.png"></a>
    <figcaption>Figure 4: Third iteration of CORDIC.</figcaption>
</figure>

We repeat this process of rotating clockwise or counterclockwise depending on whether our vector is currently over or under the desired angle.
Each iteration, the angle we rotate by gets progressively smaller.
Specifically, the angle at iteration $$k$$ is given by

$$\theta_k = \arctan(2^{-k}).$$

This is repeated either for a finite number of iterations or until some tolerance is reached.

<figure class>
    <a href="/assets/cordic/images/cordic_11.png"><img src="/assets/cordic/images/cordic_11.png"></a>
    <figcaption>Figure 5: 11 iterations of CORDIC.</figcaption>
</figure>

The sine and cosine of $$\pi / 5$$ are then given by the $$y$$ and $$x$$ components of the final vector.

But how is the rotation of the vector computed?
Why are we rotating by this particular angle sequence?
Wouldn't it be simpler to use a sequence like $${\pi \over 4 \cdot 2^{k}}$$, decreasing the angle by half each time?

Starting with the first of these questions, the rotation matrix for an angle $$\theta$$ measured counter clockwise from the positive $$x$$-axis is given by

$$
U_\theta =
\begin{bmatrix}
\cos \theta & -\sin \theta \\
\sin \theta & \cos \theta \\
\end{bmatrix}\\
\qquad = \cos \theta
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & -\tan \theta \\
\tan \theta & 1 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Using our angle schedule of $$\theta_k = \arctan (2^{-k})$$, we see that each iteration of the CORDIC algorithm is performing the rotation

$$U_{\theta_k} =
\cos(\tan^{-1}(2^{-k}))
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & -\sigma_k\cdot \tan(\tan^{-1}(2^{-k})) \\
\sigma_k \cdot \tan(\tan^{-1}(2^{-k})) & 1 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

where $$\sigma_k$$ is 1 if the rotation is clockwise and -1 if counter-clockwise.
The cosine term essentially asks "what is the cosine of the angle whose tangent is $$2^{-k}$$?".
If the tangent is $$2^{-k}$$, then the opposite leg of the right triangle can be treated as $$2^{-k}$$ while the adjacent leg as 1.
This makes the hypotenuse $$\sqrt{1+2^{-2k}}$$, making  $$\cos \theta_k = (1+2^{-2k})^{-1/2}$$.

Our CORDIC rotation then simplifies to

$$U_{\theta_k} =
{1 \over \sqrt{1+2^{-2k}}}
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & -\sigma_k\cdot 2^{-k} \\
\sigma_k\cdot 2^{-k} & 1 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

It now becomes clear why we chose the angle schedule of $$\theta_k = \arctan(2^{-k})$$ rather than simply halving the angle at each iteration.

The rotation matrix requires computing the tangent.
Defining the angle based on the arctangent makes the computation trivial.
In applications using fixed point arithmetic (rather than floating point), this is as simple as a k-bit left shift.

In fact, plotting the two angle sequences, we see that the schedules are actually quite similar.

<figure class>

    <figcaption>Figure 6: arctangent angle schedule vs halving angle schedule.</figcaption>
</figure>

The full CORDIC computation is just a cascade of matrix multiplications against the unit vector on the $$x$$-axis

$$v =
K_N
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & -\sigma_{N-1}\cdot 2^{-{N-1}} \\
\sigma_{N-1}\cdot 2^{-{N-1}} & 1 \\
\end{bmatrix}
\cdots
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & -\sigma_0\cdot 1 \\
\sigma_0\cdot 1 & 1 \\
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
1 \\
0 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Where $$K_N = \prod_{k=0}^{N-1} {1 \over \sqrt{1+2^{-2k}}}$$ is called the _gain_.
The gain depends only on the number of rotations, but not the direction of each individual rotation.
This means it can be computed offline and retrieved from a small lookup table.
Denoting the gain as $$K_N$$ and taking the logarithm, we have

$$\log K_N = -0.5 \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} \log \left({1 + 2^{-2k}}\right)$$

One natural question to ask is whether this series converges as $$N$$ goes to infinity.
Since $$\log(1+x) \approx x$$ for small $$x$$, we can see the series behaves similar to $$\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} 2^{-2k}$$ which is a convergent geometric series.
As shown in Figure 7, the product does indeed converge and rather rapidly to approximately $$0.607$$.

The entire CORDIC algorithm is implemented in the following python code

{% highlight python %}
import numpy as np

ARCTAN_LOOKUP = [np.atan(1 / 2**i) for i in range(100)]

def cordic_iter(
    i: int,
    v: np.ndarray,
    ccw: bool,
    scale: bool = False
):
    v_x, v_y = v
    two_factor = 2**-i  # need to make this into bit shifting...

    if ccw:
        sigma = 1
        x_coord = v_x - sigma * two_factor * v_y
        y_coord = sigma * v_x * two_factor + v_y
    else:
        sigma = -1

        if theta_hat == theta:
            return cos_theta, sin_theta

        ccw = theta_hat < theta
        delta_theta = ARCTAN_LOOKUP[i]
        if ccw:
            theta_hat += delta_theta
        else:
            theta_hat -= delta_theta

## Hyperbolic Functions

Recall that the unit circle is given by the set of points satisfying

$$ x^2 + y^2 =1.$$

Because of the trigonometric identity $$\sin^2 \theta + \cos^2 \theta =1$$, the unit circle can be parametrised by

$$
x(\theta) = \cos \theta\\
y(\theta) = \sin \theta
$$

where $$\theta$$ is the angle.
The hyperbolic sine and cosine are given by

$$
\begin{align*}
\cosh \theta &= {e^\theta + e^{-\theta} \over 2}\\
\sinh \theta &= {e^\theta - e^{-\theta} \over 2}\\
\end{align*}
$$

Instead of satisfying the equation for the unit circle, the hyperbolic functions satisfy a slightly different equation - the equation for the unit _hyperbola_,

$$x^2 - y^2 = 1.$$

The hyperbolic sine and cosine satisfy very similar identities as their trigonometric counterparts.

For example,

$$\sinh(\theta + \phi) = \cosh(\theta)\sinh(\phi) + \sinh(\theta)\cosh(\phi)$$

which is exactly the same as for the trigonometric case.

$${d \over d\theta} \sinh(\theta) = \cosh(\theta)$$

is another identity that holds for its trigonometric counterpart.
Other identities are nearly the same as with their trigonometric versions but differ by a sign such as

$${d \over d\theta} \cosh(\theta) = \sinh(\theta)$$

which differs by a negative sign for the circular sine and cosine.
In the case of the trigonometric functions, the parameter $$\theta$$ has the geometric interpretation of the angle made with the positive $$x$$-axis, but what exactly is the geometric meaning of $$\theta$$ in the case of hyperbolic functions?

## Hyperbolic Angles

An angle $$\theta$$ is typically defined in terms of the arc length swept out on the unit circle.
But another, equivalent, way to define an angle is by the _area_ of the sector it sweeps out.
For a circle of radius $$r$$ and an angle $$\theta$$, the ratio of the area of the sector to the full circle is the same as the ratio of the angle to that of the full circle.

$$
{A \over \pi r^2} = {\theta \over 2\pi}\\
$$

Rearranging terms, the area of the sector is $$A = {1 \over 2}r^2\theta$$.
For the unit circle, this simplifies to $$A= {\theta \over 2}$$.
So we can define an angle as twice the area of the sector it sweeps out on the unit circle (as shown in Figure 8).

<figure class="half">
    <a href="/assets/cordic/images/circular_angle_01.png"><img src="/assets/cordic/images/circular_angle_01.png"></a>
    <a href="/assets/cordic/images/circular_angle_02.png"><img src="/assets/cordic/images/circular_angle_02.png"></a>
    <figcaption>Figure 8: Area of sectors for different theta.</figcaption>
</figure>

Now let's see if we can similarly define a _hyperbolic_ angle by relating it to an area swept out on the unit hyperbola.

From figure 9 we see that the area can be computed by taking the area of the triangle and subtracting the red portion.

<figure class>
    <a href="/assets/cordic/images/area_hyperbola.png"><img src="/assets/cordic/images/area_hyperbola.png"></a>
    <figcaption>Figure 9: The area of a hyperbolic sector is shown in blue.</figcaption>
</figure>

Since the right branch of the hyperbola is parametrised by

$$
x(\theta) = \cosh \theta\\
y(\theta) =  \sinh \theta
$$

the blue area in figure 9 is then given by

$$
A = {1 \over 2} \cosh \theta \sinh \theta - \int_1^{\cosh \theta} \sqrt{x^2-1}\, dx
$$

Making the substitution $$x = \cosh t$$ and $$dx = \sinh t\, dt$$

$$
\begin{align*}
A &= {1 \over 2} \cosh \theta \sinh \theta - \int_0^\theta \sinh^2 t\, dt\\
&= {1 \over 4} \sinh 2\theta - \int_0^\theta {1 \over 2} (\cosh 2t - 1)\, dt\\
&= {1 \over 4} \sinh 2\theta - {1 \over 2} \left({1 \over 2} \sinh 2t - t\right)_0^\theta\\
&= {1 \over 4} \sinh 2\theta - {1 \over 4}\sinh 2\theta +{\theta \over 2}\\
&= {\theta \over 2}
\end{align*}
$$

This is the exact same relationship we found between the angle and its sector on the unit circle!
In addition to the various identities shared with the trigonometric functions, this relationship further cements the idea that the arguments to hyperbolic functions are indeed a type of angle.

Figure 10 shows two hyperbolic angles and their areas.

## Hyperbolic CORDIC

To compute sine and cosine, we used a circular rotation matrix

$$
U_\theta =
\begin{bmatrix}
\cos \theta & -\sin \theta\\
\sin \theta & \cos \theta\\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

to repeatedly rotate the vector by particular amounts depending on whether it was over or under the desired angle.
We can perform nearly the same procedure to compute the hyperbolic sine and cosine.
In particular, we define the hyperbolic rotation matrix

$$
H_\theta =
\begin{bmatrix}
\cosh \theta & \sinh \theta\\
\sinh \theta & \cosh \theta\\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

to rotate a vector.
Crucially, the vector is no longer rotated on the unit circle but on the right branch of the unit hyperbola.
Proceeding in the same way as circular CORDIC, we use the angle schedule based on the inverse hyperbolic tangent rather than the inverse tangent

$$\theta_k = \tanh^{-1}(2^{-k})$$

Because $$\lim_{x\rightarrow 1} \tanh^{-1} x = \infty$$, we start our index $$k$$ at 1 rather than 0.
Our hyperbolic rotation matrix can then be written as

$$H_{\theta_k} =
\cosh(\tanh^{-1}(2^{-k}))
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & \sigma_k\cdot 2^{-k} \\
\sigma_k \cdot 2^{-k} & 1 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Using the identity $$\cosh^2 \theta - \sinh^2 \theta = 1$$ and dividing through by $$\cosh^2 \theta$$, we have

$$\cosh(\theta) = {1 \over \sqrt{1-\tanh^2 \theta}}$$

which leads to the simplified form of the hyperbolic rotation matrix

$$
H_{\theta_k} =
{1 \over \sqrt{1-2^{-2k}}}
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & \sigma_k\cdot 2^{-k} \\
\sigma_k \cdot 2^{-k} & 1 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Then the final output vector for our hyperbolic implementation of CORDIC is given by the product of all the hyperbolic rotation matrices

$$v =
K_N
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & \sigma_{N}\cdot 2^{-N} \\
\sigma_{N}\cdot 2^{-N} & 1 \\
\end{bmatrix}
\cdots
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & \sigma_1\cdot 2^{-1} \\
\sigma_1\cdot 2^{-1} & 1 \\
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
1 \\
0 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

where $$K_N = \prod_{k=1}^{N} {1 \over \sqrt{1-2^{-2k}}}$$ is the hyperbolic gain<sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup>.
Just as in circular CORDIC, the $$\sigma_i$$ are chosen at each step based on whether the vector has rotated past the desired angle.

<a name="footnote1">1</a>: A similar analysis to the circular gain shows that this product also rapidly converges. Its value is $$\approx 1.2051$$ for large $$N$$.
