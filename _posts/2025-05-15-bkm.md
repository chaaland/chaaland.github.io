In this article we'll explore yet another method for accurately calculating exponentials.
Similar in spirit to [CORDIC](../cordic), the Bajard-Kla-Muller (BKM) algorithm is a simple procedure that is friendly to hardware without floating point units (FPUs).
Unlike using the Taylor series which involves expensive divisions, BKM involves only additions, multiplications, and bit-shifts.

In this article, we'll first explore how BKM can be used to compute logarithms, then show how the same idea can be used to compute exponentials.

## Logarithmic BKM

We'll start with computing logarithms using the BKM algorithm in so-called _L_-mode.
The basic idea is to represent the number we want to compute the logarithm of as the product of other numbers which we _do_ know the logarithm of.

$$
x = \prod_{k=0}^N a_k
$$

Using the property $$\log(ab) = \log(a) + \log(b)$$, we can compute the logarithm as

$$
\log x = \sum_{k=1}^N \log a_k
$$

This reformulation appears to increase complexity rather than reduce it.
Instead of computing the logarithm of a single number $$x$$, we now need to compute the logarithm of $$n$$ different numbers.

The critical insight of the algorithm is that the sequence $$a_k$$​ comprises a finite set of values, enabling efficient computation through lookup tables.
This allows us to compute values of $$\log a_k$$ offline (using some other method) and then look them up in a table as needed.

### Worked Example

To see how this works in practice, it's best to illustrate with a concrete example.

Suppose we want to compute $$\log 3.14$$.
We start by initialising a variable $$\hat{x}=1$$.
We then multiply this by 2 to get $$\hat{x}=2$$.
Since this is below our desired value of $$x=3.14$$, we'll try increasing the value again but instead of doubling it, we'll multiply 1.5.
This gives a new value of $$\hat{x}=3$$ which is still below the desired value.

We'll try increasing our value again, this time by a factor of 1.25 which gives $$\hat{x}=3.75$$.
Now our value is too large so we leave $$\hat{x}=3$$.
We then try multiplying by 1.125 which gives $$\hat{x} = 3.375$$.
This is still larger than our desired value of 3.14 so we skip this update as well.
Next we try multiplying by 1.0625 which gives $$\hat{x} = 3.1875$$, which is again too large so we skip the update.

We try multiplying $$\hat{x}=3$$ by 1.03125 which gives 3.09375.
This is less than our target value so we accept the update.
The procedure continues this way either for a finite number of iterations or until $$\hat{x}$$ is within a desired tolerance of the target.

The approximation can be concisely written as

$$
x = \prod_{k=0}^N (1+2^{-k})^{d_k}
$$

where $$d_k$$ depends on the particular input $$x$$.
We set $$d_k = 1$$ if $$\hat{x} \cdot (1+2{−k})\le x$$ and $$d_k​=0$$ otherwise, where $$\hat{x}$$ is our current approximation.
Given this equivalent expression for $$x$$, $$\log x$$ can be computed as

$$
\log x = \sum_{k=0}^N d_k \log(1+2^{-k})
$$

Figure 1 shows the steps in building up $$\hat{x}$$ for $$x=3.14$$.

### Code

The main benefit of BKM is that it can be implemented easily on hardware without floating point units.
If implemented using fixed precision arithmetic, the multiplication by $$2^{-k}$$ can be implemented as a $$k$$-bit right shift so that no divisions are necessary.

The following python code implements the algorithm using floating point to avoid getting lost in the details of fixed point implementations.

{% highlight python %}
import math

# table would be cached in read only memory in a real impl
LOGARITHM_LOOKUP = [math.log(1 + 2.0**-k) for k in range(100)]

def log(x: float, n_iters: int = 30):
    assert n_iters < 30

    log_x = 0
    x_hat = 1
    factor = 1
    for k in range(n_iters):
        # Compute the candidate for x_hat * (1 + 2^{-k})
        tmp = x_hat + x_hat * factor
        if tmp <= x:
            log_x += LOGARITHM_LOOKUP[k]
            x_hat = tmp
        factor /= 2
    return log_x
{% endhighlight %}

Figure 2 shows the effect of choosing a larger number of iterations to approximate the logarithm.
Note how the approximation is piecewise constant (the number of levels is $$2^{n_{iters}}$$)

    <figcaption>Figure 2: L-mode BKM used to approximate the logarithm using different numbers of iterations. At 8 iterations, the approximation is already quite good.</figcaption>
</figure>

If we zoom out on this approximation, we see the algorithm only converges for a fixed interval of inputs as whown in figure 3.

    <figcaption>Figure 3: For values less than 1 or greater than ~4.768, we no longer get accurate approximations of the logarithm.</figcaption>
</figure>

This issue does not go away simply by choosing $$n_{iters}$$ to be larger but rather is a fundamental limitation of BKM.

By approximating our argument as

$$x \approx \prod_{k=0}^N (1+2^{-k})^{d_k}$$

The maximum value we can achieve (with $$d_k=1$$ for all $$k$$) is $$\prod_{k=0}^N (1+2^{−k})\approx 4.768$$ as $$N\rightarrow \infty$$.

    <figcaption>Figure 4: The product approximation asymptotes around 4.768.</figcaption>
</figure>

Similarly, the smallest value we can achieve (i.e. all $$d_k = 0$$) is 1.
So before using BKM, we have to ensure our argument lies in this interval.
As an example, suppose we wanted to compute $$\log 6.28$$.
We could rewrite this as $$\log(2 \cdot 3.14) = \log 2 + \log 3.14$$ and use BKM to compute each of the logarithms.
This process is called _argument reduction_.

## Exponential BKM

In the previous section we discussed how BKM is used to compute the natural logarithm.
Using a very similar procedure, it can be adapted to compute the exponential as well (E-mode BKM).

We'll try to approximate the input as

$$ x \approx \sum_{k=0}^{N} d_k \log (1+2^{-k})$$

where $$d_k \in \{0,1\}$$.
The exponential is

$$e^x \approx \prod_{k=0}^N (1+2^{-k})^{d_k}$$

which is almost exactly the same equation from L-mode BKM!

The E-mode implementation is shown in Python below

{% highlight python %}
def exp(x: float, n_iters: int = 30) -> float:
    # y = e^x
    log_y = 0
    y_hat = 1

    for k in range(n_iters):
        tmp = log_y + LOGARITHM_LOOKUP[k]
        if tmp < x:
            log_y = tmp
            y_hat = y_hat + y_hat / 2**k  # x * (1 + 2**-k)

    return y_hat
{% endhighlight %}

As a concrete example of this algorithm, consider trying to compute $$e^{0.5}$$.
We start with $$\hat{y}= 1$$ which means $$\log \hat{y} = 0$$.
We then add $$\log 2 \approx 0.693$$ to our approximate logarithm but this would exceed our target value of 0.5 so we skip this update and keep $$\hat{y} = 1$$ and $$\log \hat{y} =0$$.

On the second iteration we try adding $$\log 1.5 \approx 0.405$$ which does not exceed our target of 0.5 so we update $$\log \hat{y} = 0.405$$ and $$\hat{y} = 1.5$$.
On the third iteration we try adding $$\log 1.25 \approx 0.223$$ but this would make $$\log \hat{y} = 0.63$$ which would exceed 0.5 so we skip this update.
The fourth iteration also leads to a skip since $$\log 1.125 \approx 0.118$$.

The fifth iteration however uses $$\log 1.0625 \approx 0.0606$$ which when added to $$\log \hat{y}$$ gives $$\approx 0.466$$ which is below the input of 0.5 so we update $$\hat{y} = 1.5 * 1.0625 = 1.59375$$.

The algorithm proceeds in this way, continually attempting to add $$\log (1+2^{-k})$$ to $$\log \hat{y}$$ and checking if it would exceed the input $$x$$.

Figure 5 shows how the accuracy of E-mode BKM improves as the number of iterations increases.

    <figcaption>Figure 5: Comparison of 2, 4, and 8 iterations against the true value of the exponential.</figcaption>
</figure>

Similar to the L-mode algorithm, there is only a small range of values for which the algorithm will converge to the correct answer.
Figure 6 shows how outside the interval $$[0, 1.562)$$, BKM will fail to compute a correct answer.<sup>[1](#footnote1).
Using the property $$e^{a+b} = e^{a} e^{b}$$, we can bring arguments into the range of use for E-mode BKM.

## Conclusion

The BKM algorithm is an ingenious method for efficient computation of exponentials and logarithms using only additions, multiplications, and bit-shifts.
Admitting the use of complex numbers, BKM can even be adapted to compute various trigonometric functions as well.
